Difficulties I faced:
The overall setup of the code is poor. Therefore, adding changes was very annoying. 
However, in the end I managaed to get most of the code pretty decent and a massive decrease in redundant code. 
This is something I need to work on in the future.

Currently there is a bug if you want to choose difficulty and you spam a number, it will show each attempt after difficulty has been chosen.
I found this bug too late so I didn't have time to debug it. 
Overall the code is pretty safe from wrong inputs and I found it diffucult for it to break, something I am pleased with.

It was pretty fun adding the "fun" difficulty, something to spice it up.

There might also be an issue when initially playing where the game might be slightly difficult to understand in the beginning.
How the guesses works with the rounds.
There should probably be some option for an explanation or it being given to you as you run the code.
